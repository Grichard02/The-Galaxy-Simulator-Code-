# The-Galaxy-Simulator-Code-
The galaxy simulator code will calculate the probability of detection for any number of civilizations and radio bubble sizes, and then generate a graphical model of the galaxy. When a bubble the size of our current emissions bubble is used, it will post and annotate our bubble in red, in the approximate location of our solar system.
